Not sure if we have a Java version limit? I'll go with 21 for now

Rebuilding it to a spring-boot project, setting up the environment as a maven project, did you rather want it as a standalone project, so we could've gone as some kind of serverless solution?

I notice right away that we're working with a couple of deprecated methods, are we limited to Date for some reason, or was it just a starting point?
